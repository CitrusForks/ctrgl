ctrgl - a far-from-complete OpenGL implementation for the POS PICA
=====

Heavily based on code from [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib).

This project would never have been possible without all the great people behind 3Dbrew and ctrulib.
Special thanks to Smealum for blessing us with code exec in the first place.
